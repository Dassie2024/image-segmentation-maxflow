    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The Max-Flow and Min-Cut problem plays a crucial role in network flow theory and has significant applications in various fields, particularly in computer vision. By modeling the image as a graph, the Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem can be used to perform image segmentation, partitioning the image into foreground and background. This paper discusses the theory behind the Max-Flow Min-Cut problem, its application to image segmentation, and the implementation and analysis of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to solve the problem. The limitations of greedy methods for segmentation are explored, along with an implementation of the image segmentation algorithm.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Max-Flow and Min-Cut problem</strong> plays a pivotal role in <strong>network flow theory</strong> and has found significant applications in various fields, particularly in <strong>computer vision</strong>, a subfield of artificial intelligence that explores the interpretation and analysis of images and videos. One prominent application is <strong>image segmentation</strong>, which focuses on partitioning an image into meaningful regions based on pixel intensities. This segmentation is crucial for simplifying image analysis, detecting objects, or extracting valuable information from images. By treating an image as a <strong>graph</strong>, where each pixel corresponds to a <strong>node</strong> and the relationships between adjacent pixels are represented as <strong>edges</strong>, the <strong>Max-Flow Min-Cut</strong> algorithm provides a powerful method for performing optimal image segmentation. This is achieved by finding a <strong>cut</strong> in the graph that separates the image into distinct regions (such as foreground and background) while minimizing the boundary between the regions, which is desirable in many computer vision tasks <a href="#ref-damlemax">[1]</a>.

    <h2>Network Flow and Graph Theory Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In <strong>network flow theory</strong>, a <strong>flow network</strong> is a directed graph \(G = (V, E)\) consisting of <strong>vertices</strong> and <strong>edges</strong>, where each node has at least one edge, and each edge has a nonnegative integer <strong>capacity</strong>. The network has two special vertices: a <strong>source</strong> \( s \) that has no incoming edges and a <strong>sink</strong> \( t \) that has no outgoing edges. A \(s\)-\(t\) flow represents the amount of traffic being passed through the network. The goal is to send as much flow as possible from the source to the sink, without exceeding the capacity of any edge \(c_e\), where for each edge \( e \in E \), we have \( 0 \leq f(e) \leq c_e \), and while maintaining the <strong>flow conservation</strong> property. This property ensures that the total flow into a vertex is equal to the total flow out, except for the source and sink <a href="#ref-boykov2001">[2]</a>. Mathematically, this is expressed as
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.1em;">
      \[
      \sum_{e \text{ into } v} f(e) = \sum_{e \text{ out of } v} f(e)
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem of <strong>maximum flow</strong> becomes relevant as the goal becomes to direct the traffic in the most efficient way that enables the use of all available capacity. The upper bound of flow that is able to pass through is constrained by the edge capacity from disjoint sets \(A\) to \(B\), where \(A\) includes the source and \(B\) includes the sink, and since any flow from \(s\) to \(t\) must cross \(A\) and \(B\), then choosing such vertices implies finding a minimum cut. A <strong>cut</strong> in the network is defined as this particular partition of \(A\) and \(B\) and the <strong>capacity of the cut</strong> is the sum of the capacities of the edges that cross the partition. The <strong>Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem</strong> states that the maximum flow in the network is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut, which is the cut with the smallest capacity. This equivalence forms the foundation of many practical algorithms for solving flow problems, including those applied in image segmentation <a href="#ref-kleinberg2006algorithm">[3]</a>.

    <h2>Graph Representation of Images for Segmentation</h2>
    <p>
      Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, aimed at partitioning an image into meaningful segments or regions. One effective approach to image segmentation involves utilizing <strong>Graph Cuts</strong>, a technique that transforms the image into a graph representation. Each pixel in the image is represented as a vertex in the graph, and the connections between adjacent pixels are represented as edges. By framing the segmentation problem as a <strong>graph cut</strong>, we can efficiently separate the foreground and background of the image. In this framework, the image is represented as a flow network, where the source vertex \( s \) corresponds to the foreground and the sink vertex \( t \) corresponds to the background.
    </p>

    <h3>Affinities in Image Segmentation</h3>
    <p>
      The key concept in graph-based segmentation is the <strong>affinity</strong> between neighboring pixels. Affinity refers to how similar or dissimilar two pixels are, and it is represented by the weight of the edge between them. In practice, the affinity \( w(i,j) \) between two pixels \( i \) and \( j \) is often based on their color or intensity values, though it can be extended to other features.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.1em;">
      \[
      S(f_i, f_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{k} (f_{ik} - f_{jk})^2}
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      where \( f_i \) and \( f_j \) are feature vectors for pixels \( i \) and \( j \), respectively. The affinity is then defined as:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.1em;">
      \[
      w(i,j) = A(f_i, f_j) = \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} S(f_i, f_j) \right)
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, \( \sigma \) is a parameter that controls the sensitivity of the affinity <a href="#ref-7024152">[4]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smaller the dissimilarity \( S(f_i, f_j) \) between two pixels, the higher their affinity. This concept is central to the <strong>Graph Cut</strong> algorithm, where we seek to minimize the number of cuts through highly-affine (similar) pixels while maximizing the cuts through low-affinity (dissimilar) pixels. The most cost of the cut between the disjoint subsets \(V_A\) and \(V_B\) is the summation of weights of cut-set edges, where
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.1em;">
      \[
      C(V_A,V_B) = \sum_{u \in V_A, v \in V_B} {w(u,v)}
      \]
    </p>

    <h3>Formulation of the Segmentation Problem</h3>

    <p>In the context of image segmentation, the objective is to partition the pixels into two disjoint subsets: the foreground and the background. Thus, we introduce two special vertices: a super-source <em>s</em> and a super-sink <em>t</em>, representing the foreground and background, respectively. These vertices are connected to all other pixels in the image.</p>

    <p>The capacities of the edges between the super-source and the pixels are denoted as \( a_i \), and the capacities between the pixels and the super-sink are denoted as \( b_i \). The capacities between neighboring pixels \( i \) and \( j \) are given by \( p_{ij} \), as seen in the image below depicting four pixels and their three types of edges:</p>

    <!-- Insert your image here -->
    <img src="images/s-t cut.png" alt="Graph with 4 Pixels Demonstrating s-t Cut" style="max-width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto;" />
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.9em;">Figure: Graph with 4 Pixels Demonstrating s-t Cut. Source: Kleinberg (2006).</p>

    <p>This transforms the segmentation problem into finding a minimum cut that separates the foreground from the background.</p>

    <p>For an optimal graph cut, we want:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pixels within the same subset (foreground or background) to have high affinities.</li>
    <li>Pixels from different subsets (foreground vs. background) to have low affinities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since neighboring pixels are more likely to have higher affinities, this assignment creates smoother boundaries between the foreground and background. To create this smoothness, a penalty term for the boundaries must be introduced that minimizes the boundaries between the background and foreground.</p>

    <p>This can be mathematically formulated as an optimization problem where \(p_{ij}\) penalizes neighboring pairs with one pixel in A and the other in B, and the goal is to maximize the segmentation value \( q(A,B) \), defined as:</p>

    \[
    q(A,B) = \sum_{i \in A} a_i + \sum_{j \in B} b_j - \sum_{\substack{(i,j) \in E \\ |A \cap \{i,j\}| = 1}} p_{ij}
    \]

    <p>The first two summations describe the likelihood of pixels belonging to set \(A\) and set \(B\), which is captured by their affinities described above. Alternatively, we can define the minimization problem:</p>

    \[
    q'(A,B) = \sum_{i \in A} b_i + \sum_{j \in B} a_j + \sum_{\substack{(i,j) \in E \\ |A \cap \{i,j\}| = 1}} p_{ij}
    \]

    <p>In the first equation, we maximize the segmentation value by rewarding high affinities and penalizing cuts between pixels in different sets. The second equation enables us to frame the <strong>Segmentation Problem</strong> as a <strong>minimum-cut problem</strong>.</p>

    <p>The total cost of a cut is the sum of the capacities:</p>

    \[
    C(A,B) = \sum_{i \in A} b_i + \sum_{j \in B} a_j + \sum_{\substack{(i,j) \in E \\ |A \cap \{i,j\}| = 1}} p_{ij}
    \]

    <p>This cost is equivalent to \( q'(A,B) \), and by finding the minimum cut in the graph, we obtain an optimal segmentation (Kleinberg, 2006).</p>

  <section id="graph-cuts">
  <h2>Boykov and Funka-Lea Paper on Graph Cuts in Image Segmentation</h2>
  <p>
    In order to design the minimum-cut problem, with source and sink vertices, a seminal paper called 
    "<em>Graph Cuts and Efficient N-D Image Segmentation</em>" by Boykov and Funka-Lea describe edges in the graph being divided into two types:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>N-links (Neighborhood Links):</strong> These connect a pixel to its neighboring pixels (typically the four immediate neighbors in a grid-based image). The capacity of the edge between two pixels is determined by their <strong>intensity difference \(I_P\) and \(I_Q\)</strong>. If two pixels are similar in intensity, the edge between them will have a high capacity, and if the pixels are different, the capacity will be lower. This means that pixels with similar intensities will likely remain in the same segment, while dissimilar pixels will be more likely to be separated.</li>
    <li><strong>T-links (Terminal Links):</strong> These connect each pixel to the <strong>source</strong> or <strong>sink</strong>, depending on whether the pixel is more likely to belong to the foreground or background. The capacities of these edges are determined by the <strong>pixel intensity</strong> relative to the foreground and background. A pixel with high intensity similar to the background will have a high capacity linking it to the sink, while a pixel similar to the foreground will have a high capacity linking it to the source.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The authors use the following penalty term for assigning a pixel to the boundary between foreground and background whenever there is a discontinuity or boundary between two neighboring pixels \(p\) and \(q\) is modeled using a <strong>boundary penalty</strong> function:
  </p>

  <div style="text-align:center; margin: 1em 0;">
    $$ 
    B(p, q) \propto \exp \left( -\frac{(I_p - I_q)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\text{dist}(p, q)} 
    $$
  </div>

  <p>
    Here, \( I_p \) and \( I_q \) are the intensities of neighboring pixels, and \( \sigma \) is a parameter determined experimentally. When \(|I_P - I_q| < \sigma\), the function heavily penalizes for discontinuities between both pixels, and otherwise assigns a small penalty when \(|I_P - I_q| > \sigma\). Thus, \( \sigma \) is an estimated measure of "camera noise" where the function can be seen as a distribution of noise among a neighborhood of pixels in an image. Overall, this function ensures that similar pixels are less likely to be separated by the cut, while dissimilar pixels are penalized for being on opposite sides of the cut <sup>[1]</sup>.

  <p>
    In the next section, the specific algorithm used to determine the optimal max-flow will be discussed, beginning with an examination of why a greedy algorithm falls short in this context.

  <section id="greedy-failure">
  <h2>Why Greedy Algorithms Do Not Work for Min-Cut Max-Flow</h2>
  <p>
    Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices in the hope that these choices will lead to a globally optimal solution. However, in the case of the Max-Flow Min-Cut problem, greedy algorithms do not work effectively. The reason is that a greedy algorithm typically focuses on individual edges or vertices in the flow network, and it might make decisions based solely on local conditions (e.g., pixel intensities) without considering the global structure of the flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    To see why greedy algorithms fail, consider the following network with four vertices: source \( s \), sink \( t \), and two intermediate vertices \( u \) and \( v \).
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="images/greedy.png" alt="Network Flow: A Greedy and Optimal Solution for Finding the Max-Flow" style="max-width: 50%;">
    <figcaption>Network Flow: A Greedy and Optimal Solution for Finding the Max-Flow</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    A greedy algorithm might select the path with the highest immediate capacity, \( s \to u \), \( u \to v \), then \( v \to t \) resulting in a flow of 20. However, this greedy approach will fail to utilize the maximum flow, because in fact, the maximum flow is 30 by way of <strong>augmenting the flow</strong> along path P. This <strong>augmenting path</strong> can be achieved by pushing back 10 units of flow on \( u \to v \), and then having a valid flow from \( u \to t \) and \( v \to t \) which results in a net flow of 30.
  </p>

  <p>
    The greedy algorithm, by choosing the edge with the immediate maximum capacity and pushing as much flow as it can, fails to see the global structure of the network and the potential for larger flows that could be achieved by pushing flow back and augmenting other paths. Therefore, greedy algorithms often do not account for the global relationships between edges and vertices, leading to suboptimal solutions <sup>[2]</sup>.

  <h2>Edmonds-Karp Max-Flow Min-Cut Algorithm</h2>

  <p>
    The image segmentation framework relies on the <strong>Edmonds-Karp algorithm</strong>, a specific implementation of Ford-Fulkerson that uses <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> to find augmenting paths.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Ford-Fulkerson method</strong> proceeds iteratively by finding augmenting paths in the residual network (a network that accounts for the available capacity after each flow update) and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found. The algorithm terminates when no augmenting paths exist, and the flow is maximized.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Edmonds-Karp algorithm</strong> is an implementation of Ford-Fulkerson that specifically uses <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> to find augmenting paths in the residual graph. It ensures that the augmenting paths are found in the shortest possible number of edges, which helps improve the algorithm's efficiency.
    The inputs to the Edmonds-Karp algorithm include the capacity matrix, where \( C_{ij} \) represents the capacity of the edge from vertex \( i \) to vertex \( j \), the adjacency matrix, where \( E_{ij} \) indicates whether there is an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \), the source node \(s\), where the flow originates, and the sink node \( t \), where the flow terminates. The output gives the maximum flow from the source node \( s \) to the sink node \( t \) <sup>[3]</sup>.

  <h3>Proof of Correctness for the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm</h3>

  <p>
    The use of BFS in the Edmonds-Karp algorithm ensures that the number of phases required to compute the maximum flow is polynomially bounded. The correctness of the algorithm is guaranteed through several key properties, including the <strong>Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem</strong>, the <strong>integrality of flow values</strong>, and the <strong>bounded number of augmenting phases</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>Termination of Algorithm</h4>
  <p>
    The Edmonds-Karp algorithm starts with an initial flow of zero and iteratively finds augmenting paths where each node in the graph has integer capacities. Once no augmenting path exists, the algorithm terminates. Since each augmenting path increases the flow by at least one unit of flow, and the maximum possible flow is finite (it is bounded by the total capacity of the network), the algorithm must eventually terminate.
  </p>

  <h4>Correctness of Flow</h4>
  <p>
    At each step, the flow along the augmenting path is increased by the bottleneck capacity, and the residual graph is updated accordingly. The residual graph ensures that no flow is sent along an edge that would exceed its capacity, so the flow remains valid. The flow conserves the total incoming and outgoing flow for each vertex, except for the source and sink. This ensures that the flow is properly maintained during the execution of the algorithm.
  </p>

  <h4>Max-Flow and Min-Cut Theorem</h4>
  <p>
    Once the algorithm terminates, the flow in the residual graph represents the maximum flow because no more augmenting paths can be found. By the <strong>Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem</strong>, this flow corresponds to the minimum cut in the network, which separates the source \( s \) and the sink \( t \). The final flow value is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut, which ensures that the algorithm computes the maximum flow.
  </p>

  <h4>Bounded Number of Phases</h4>
  <p>
    The key innovation of Edmonds-Karp over the basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is the use of BFS to find augmenting paths. This ensures that the shortest augmenting path is selected at each step, and the number of phases is bounded. Specifically, the number of phases is bounded by \( O(V \cdot E) \), where \( V \) is the number of vertices and \( E \) is the number of edges in the graph. The fact that the distance of any vertex from the source (in terms of the number of edges) does not decrease during the execution of the algorithm implies that each augmenting path improves the flow in the network, and thus the algorithm makes progress in each phase.
  </p>

  <h4>Conclusion of Proof of Correctness</h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>Edmonds-Karp algorithm</strong> is a correct and efficient implementation of the <strong>Ford-Fulkerson method</strong> for computing maximum flow in a flow network. By using <strong>Breadth-First Search</strong> to find augmenting paths, the algorithm avoids pathological cases of the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, where the number of augmenting steps could be unbounded. A crucial assumption for the termination guarantee is that all edge capacities are <strong>integers</strong>. Under this condition, each augmenting path increases the flow by at least one unit, leading to a guaranteed polynomial time termination.
  </p>

  <p>In the next section, the results from the Boykov-Funka-Lea segmentation will be analyzed and discussed.</p>

  <h2>Computational Complexity of the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm</h2>
  <p>
    The Edmonds-Karp algorithm guarantees polynomial-time performance with a time complexity of \( O(|V| \cdot E^2) \) and a space complexity of \( O(|V| + |E|) \), making it more efficient compared to the original Ford-Fulkerson method.
  </p>

  <h3>Time Complexity of Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm</h3>
  <p>
    The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(|E| \cdot f^*) \), where \( |E| \) is the number of edges and \( f^* \) is the maximum flow value.
  </p>

  <h3>Time and Space Complexity of Edmonds-Karp Algorithm</h3>
  <p>
    Each BFS runs in \( O(|V| + |E|) \) time, and the number of augmenting paths is bounded by \( O(|V| \cdot |E|) \), resulting in an overall time complexity of:

  <p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">
    \( O(|V| \cdot E^2) \)
  </p>
  <p>
    Space complexity is \( O(|V| + |E|) \) due to graph representation, BFS queue, parent array, and residual graph.

  <h2>Implementation: Experimenting with an Existing Tool for Image Segmentation</h2>
  <p>
    The tool uses the Max-Flow Min-Cut approach with user-defined foreground and background seeds. The source code is available at:
    <a href="https://github.com/julie-jiang/image-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/julie-jiang/image-segmentation/</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The program runs by accepting an image and allowing users to plant foreground and background seeds, then segments the image accordingly.
  </p>

  <h3>Execution Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place foreground seeds in the first window and press ESC to proceed.</li>
    <li>Place background seeds in the second window and press ESC to proceed.</li>
    <li>Wait for the segmented image to appear, then press ESC to save and quit.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Observations and Results</h3>
  <p>
    The segmentation was accurate when clear seeds were placed. The results depend heavily on the number and accuracy of seeds. More accurate seeds improved segmentation quality.

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Max-Flow Min-Cut problem provides an elegant and powerful method for solving the image segmentation problem in computer vision. By transforming an image into a flow network and applying the Max-Flow Min-Cut algorithm, we can efficiently segment an image into distinct regions, such as foreground and background. The ability to use graph cuts ensures that the segmentation is both optimal and effective in minimizing boundaries between segments. The <strong>Edmonds-Karp</strong> algorithm allows for an efficient solution to the Max-Flow Min-Cut problem and serves as the backbone for modern segmentation techniques in computer vision.
